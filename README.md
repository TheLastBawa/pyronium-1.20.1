Pyronium is a Minecraft Fabric Mod which adds a new material to the game, Pyronium.
This is made by alloying copper, gold and the fragile Pyronite crystals, which can only be found adjacent to lava, in any dimension.
It is a material which does not fall into the standard minecraft progression tier, similarly to gold.
However, unlike gold, it is mainly used to create light weapons such as the Pyronium Daggers, which attack fast, but deal low damage.
It also adds multiple new enchantments and potions.
For now, the mod is only for 1.20.1, but I will seek to update it soon.
